    <p>A woman has sued NASA to make sure that the US space agency doesn't take back a piece of moon gifted to her by Neil Armstrong the first person to walk on the lunar surface.
        Laura Cicco from Cincinnati has filed a lawsuit in a federal court, stating that the vial of moon dust she has was a gift from Armstrong who was a friend of her father, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday.
        Cicco's father Tom Murray, who was a pilot with the US Army, spent a lot of time together with Armstrong.
        Sometime in the 1970s, the US astronaut gave the vial of moon dust along with a handwritten note to Murray's little girl when she was 10.
        Cicco has now sued NASA because the space agency has "a history of seizing suspected lunar material from private citizens", her attorney was quoted as saying.
        "There's no law prohibiting private citizens from owning materials from the moon and Cicco is the rightful and legal owner of the moon dust," the report said, quoting the attorney.</p>
